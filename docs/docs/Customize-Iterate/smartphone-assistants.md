# Smartphone Assistants 

## iPhone Shortcuts/Siri (as of iOS 12)
**Requirements**  
You must be running iOS 12 or greater, and having the Shortcuts App (official Apple app) installed.

You must install the Shortcut on every device you wish to call the Shortcut on. For example, if you want to use Siri on your laptop _and_ your iPhone, you need to install the Shortcut on _both_ your iPhone and your laptop.

iPhone users can use the Shortcuts app (formerly known as Workflow) to create Shortcuts & Siri Commands that can interact with your OpenAPS rig and Nightscout site. 

Once created, Shortcuts can be shared with a link so that others can use them.  

**Please submit a pull request if you have created a Siri integration to share.**  
NOTE: If sharing a Shortcut link that you created, please be sure to remove your Nightscout URL or other personal information from the Shortcut

**Siri on Desktop**  
Shortcut links function best when opened in Safari on desktop. 

**Siri on iPhone/iPad**  
Clicking a Shortcut link should prompt you to add the link by clicking the `Get Shortcut` button automatically.
